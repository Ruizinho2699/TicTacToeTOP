# TicTacToeTOP

This was a challenging project. I was overwhelmed in how to use factory functions and more overwhelmed by how others used it. But after taking a break and starting slowly, I was able to finish the project while making full use of factory functions. 

I'm very chuffed with how this project turned out.
